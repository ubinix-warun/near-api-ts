/**
 * `ShardUId` is a unique representation for shards from different shard layouts.

 Comparing to `ShardId`, which is just an ordinal number ranging from 0 to NUM_SHARDS-1,
 `ShardUId` provides a way to unique identify shards when shard layouts may change across epochs.
 This is important because we store states indexed by shards in our database, so we need a
 way to unique identify shard even when shards change across epochs.
 Another difference between `ShardUId` and `ShardId` is that `ShardUId` should only exist in
 a node's internal state while `ShardId` can be exposed to outside APIs and used in protocol
 level information (for example, `ShardChunkHeader` contains `ShardId` instead of `ShardUId`)
