/**
 * This is Action which mustn't contain DelegateAction.

 This struct is needed to avoid the recursion when Action/DelegateAction is deserialized.

 Important: Don't make the inner Action public, this must only be constructed
 through the correct interface that ensures the inner Action is actually not
 a delegate action. That would break an assumption of this type, which we use
 in several places. For example, borsh de-/serialization relies on it. If the
 invariant is broken, we may end up with a `Transaction` or `Receipt` that we
 can serialize but deserializing it back causes a parsing error.
