 * A shard layout that maps accounts evenly across all shards -- by calculate the hash of account
 id and mod number of shards. This is added to capture the old `account_id_to_shard_id` algorithm,
 to keep backward compatibility for some existing tests.
 `parent_shards` for `ShardLayoutV1` is always `None`, meaning it can only be the first shard layout
 a chain uses.
