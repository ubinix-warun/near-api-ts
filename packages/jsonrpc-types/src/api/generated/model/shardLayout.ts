/**
 * A versioned struct that contains all information needed to assign accounts to shards.

 Because of re-sharding, the chain may use different shard layout to split shards at different
 times. Currently, `ShardLayout` is stored as part of `EpochConfig`, which is generated each
 epoch given the epoch protocol version. In mainnet/testnet, we use two shard layouts since
 re-sharding has only happened once. It is stored as part of genesis config, see
 default_simple_nightshade_shard_layout() Below is an overview for some important
 functionalities of ShardLayout interface.
