 * The shard identifier. It may be an arbitrary number - it does not need to be
 a number in the range 0..NUM_SHARDS. The shard ids do not need to be
 sequential or contiguous.

 The shard id is wrapped in a new type to prevent the old pattern of using
 indices in range 0..NUM_SHARDS and casting to ShardId. Once the transition
 if fully complete it potentially may be simplified to a regular type alias.
